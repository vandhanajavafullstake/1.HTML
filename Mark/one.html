Both living and non-living things include nature, and everyone is interdependent, which helps maintain the <samp style="background-color: yellowgreen; " > ecosystem </samp>. Plants, animals, and humans all depend on nature for their survival Nature provides us with water to drink, air to breathe, food to eat, clothes to wear, and a shelter to live in. Imbalance in nature can be life-threatening to all. Many factors are disturbing the balance of nature, like industrialisation, technology, etc. <mark>Nature conservation is an important factor in saving nature.</mark>
